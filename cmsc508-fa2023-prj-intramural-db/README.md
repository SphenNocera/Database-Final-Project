This assignment includes a qmd file with a links to our database pitch and design videos, ER diagrams in Chen Notation and Crow's Foot Notation outlining our database design, the relational schema, functional dependencies and a GANTT chart describing when specific deliverables and tasks are to be completed. The biggest challenge we faced was creating the GANTT chart because this was new to us. Also, we had trouble getting the diagrams and the GANTT chart to render in the HTML file, but we were able go fix it. But after making the GANTT chart we definitely feel more comfortable going forward in being able to plan out our work. Also, the design was helpful in making sure that our ideas were achievable and not too complicated.
